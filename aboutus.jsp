    Welcome to the eBooks-Library - Now in our 13th year, we
	remain one of the largest eBooks sites on the web. Whether you're
	looking for the world's greatest literature, historical documents and
	photos, or keyboard sheet music, the eBooks-Library has it all.
	Everyone wants to know what Kindle books can be borrowed for free
	through Amazon's Kindle Owners' Lending Library. Amazingly, Amazon does
	not make this information easy to find. The good news is we have found
	the list of eBook for you. We even figured out how to search through
	the results and filter them for what you are interested in. There are
	several candidates when it comes to the smallest library in the world.
	People Anyone in the local area can access the library. They just need
	to obtain a "library card" first from Colin. The "card" consists of the
	code to unlock the library. Once a person has become a member they can
	borrow any item from the library and share any items they want by
	putting them in the library for other members to borrow. Of course the
	library is always open to members and you certainly don't have to worry
	about it being closed due to budget cuts. We think it's a great idea.
	The winner for world's smallest library also happens to be one of the
	biggest libraries in the world. The Little Free Library is a mailbox
	that is converted into a library. The first one appeared outside the
	Hudson area along a bicycle trail. Anyone can start one of these
	mailbox libraries and register them. In 2015, there were estimated to
	be over 25,000 mailbox library "branches". Amazing are very creative
	when it comes to sharing books with their community.
